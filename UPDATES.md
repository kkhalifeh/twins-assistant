Here are some updates that i need to make on the assistant:

1) Need to be able to add users under the account and assign the role, either "Parent", "Nanny" or "Viewer"

Parent: Full control
Nanny: Logging only (Feeding, Sleep, Diapers, Health) - No access to the other modules
Viewer: Can only view (all modules)

2) When logging "Feeding", if "Breast" is chosen, need to be able to log Duration (in minutes) - optional

3) When logging "Diaper" need to be able to upload an image (optional)
