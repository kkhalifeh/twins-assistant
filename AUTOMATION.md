# Automation Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the automated deployment system for seamless updates from your local machine to production.

## üéØ Overview

Once set up, here's your new workflow:

```bash
# Make changes locally
# ... edit files ...

# Test locally
npm run dev

# Commit and push - DEPLOYMENT HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY!
git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git push origin main

# ‚úÖ Done! Changes are live in ~2 minutes
```

**Plus, manage production from your local machine:**

```bash
# Delete all data on production
./scripts/production-cli.sh data:delete-all

# View production logs
./scripts/production-cli.sh logs backend

# Restart production services
./scripts/production-cli.sh restart all
```

---

## üöÄ One-Time Setup

### Step 1: Generate SSH Key for GitHub Actions

On your **local machine**:

```bash
# Generate a new SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "github-actions" -f ~/.ssh/github_actions

# Copy the private key
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions

# Copy the public key
cat ~/.ssh/github_actions.pub
```

### Step 2: Add Public Key to Production Server

```bash
# SSH into production server
ssh root@209.250.253.59

# Add the public key to authorized_keys
echo "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

# Verify permissions
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh

# Exit server
exit
```

### Step 3: Add Private Key to GitHub Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/kkhalifeh/twins-assistant`
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
5. Value: Paste the **private key** content from `~/.ssh/github_actions`
6. Click **Add secret**

### Step 4: Upload Auto-Deploy Script to Server

From your **local machine**:

```bash
# Upload the auto-deploy script
scp scripts/auto-deploy.sh root@209.250.253.59:/var/www/parenting-assistant/scripts/

# Make it executable on the server
ssh root@209.250.253.59 "chmod +x /var/www/parenting-assistant/scripts/auto-deploy.sh"
```

### Step 5: Test the Setup

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test automation" >> README.md

# Commit and push
git add README.md
git commit -m "Test automation"
git push origin main

# Go to GitHub and watch the action run:
# https://github.com/kkhalifeh/twins-assistant/actions
```

## üì¶ How It Works

### Automatic Deployment (GitHub Actions)

**Every time you push to `main`:**

1. ‚úÖ GitHub Actions detects the push
2. ‚úÖ Connects to your production server via SSH
3. ‚úÖ Pulls latest code
4. ‚úÖ Restores production configs
5. ‚úÖ Installs dependencies (if package.json changed)
6. ‚úÖ Runs database migrations (if schema changed)
7. ‚úÖ Rebuilds frontend
8. ‚úÖ Restarts services
9. ‚úÖ Verifies deployment health

**Total time: ~2-3 minutes**

You can watch the deployment in real-time:
- Go to https://github.com/kkhalifeh/twins-assistant/actions
- Click on the latest workflow run

## üéÆ Production CLI Commands

Manage your production server from your local machine using the CLI tool:

### Check Status

```bash
# View server and container status
./scripts/production-cli.sh status
```

Shows:
- Container status
- Backend health
- Frontend status
- Database tables

### View Logs

```bash
# View backend logs (live tail)
./scripts/production-cli.sh logs backend

# View frontend logs
./scripts/production-cli.sh logs frontend

# View all logs (last 30 lines each)
./scripts/production-cli.sh logs
```

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# Trigger deployment manually (without pushing to GitHub)
./scripts/production-cli.sh deploy
```

### Restart Services

```bash
# Restart backend
./scripts/production-cli.sh restart backend

# Restart frontend
./scripts/production-cli.sh restart frontend

# Restart everything
./scripts/production-cli.sh restart all
```

### Database Management

```bash
# View database status and migrations
./scripts/production-cli.sh db:status

# Run pending migrations
./scripts/production-cli.sh db:migrate

# Create a backup
./scripts/production-cli.sh db:backup

# Clean all data (DANGER!)
./scripts/production-cli.sh db:clean
```

### Data Management

```bash
# Delete all user data
./scripts/production-cli.sh data:delete-all

# Delete specific data types
./scripts/production-cli.sh data:delete-feeding
./scripts/production-cli.sh data:delete-sleep
./scripts/production-cli.sh data:delete-diapers
```

### Direct SSH Access

```bash
# SSH into production server
./scripts/production-cli.sh ssh
```

### Help

```bash
# Show all available commands
./scripts/production-cli.sh help
```

## üîÑ Your New Workflow

### Making Code Changes

```bash
# 1. Make changes locally
vim frontend/src/app/page.tsx

# 2. Test locally
npm run dev

# 3. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Update homepage"
git push origin main

# ‚úÖ Deployment happens automatically!
# Check progress: https://github.com/kkhalifeh/twins-assistant/actions
```

### Making Database Changes

```bash
# 1. Update Prisma schema
vim backend/prisma/schema.prisma

# 2. Create migration locally
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_new_field

# 3. Test migration locally
# ... test your changes ...

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add new field to User model"
git push origin main

# ‚úÖ Migration runs automatically on production!
```

### Cleaning Production Data

```bash
# Delete all data on production (for testing)
./scripts/production-cli.sh data:delete-all

# Delete specific data
./scripts/production-cli.sh data:delete-feeding
```

### Checking Production Health

```bash
# Quick status check
./scripts/production-cli.sh status

# View live backend logs
./scripts/production-cli.sh logs backend

# Create database backup
./scripts/production-cli.sh db:backup
```

## üõ†Ô∏è What Gets Automated

### ‚úÖ Automatically Handled

- **Code deployment** - Push to main ‚Üí deployed in 2 minutes
- **Dependencies** - npm install runs automatically
- **Database migrations** - Detected and applied automatically
- **Prisma client** - Regenerated automatically
- **Frontend builds** - Built and deployed automatically
- **Service restarts** - Containers restarted automatically
- **Production configs** - API URLs and settings restored automatically
- **Health checks** - Deployment verified automatically

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Manual Actions Required

- **Environment variables** - Must be updated on server manually
- **Database rollbacks** - Must be done manually if needed
- **Container rebuilds** - Only if Dockerfile changes (rare)

---

## üîê Security Notes

1. **SSH Key**: Keep your GitHub Actions SSH private key secure
2. **Never commit**: .env files, secrets, or API keys
3. **Database backups**: Run before major changes
4. **Test locally**: Always test before pushing to main

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed

```bash
# 1. Check GitHub Actions logs
# Visit: https://github.com/kkhalifeh/twins-assistant/actions

# 2. Check production logs
./scripts/production-cli.sh logs

# 3. SSH into server manually
./scripts/production-cli.sh ssh
```

### Frontend Not Updating

```bash
# Manually rebuild and restart
./scripts/production-cli.sh deploy
```

### Database Migration Failed

```bash
# Check migration status
./scripts/production-cli.sh db:status

# Try running manually
./scripts/production-cli.sh db:migrate
```

### Container Not Running

```bash
# Check status
./scripts/production-cli.sh status

# Restart all services
./scripts/production-cli.sh restart all
```
